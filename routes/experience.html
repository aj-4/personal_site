					<h2>Independent Developer</h2>
					<h5>Full-stack, focused on JS and Node</h5>
					<p> Built a CS foundation, a formidable library of projects, and a passion for development</p>
					<h5 class = "">Click to Learn More</h5>
					<div class ="j-desc">
						
					<p>In the beginning, my dormant passion for development emerged when I took Harvard's CS50 course, as recommended by a friend. </p>

					<p>
					Upon completion of the course, I knew it was the right path for me. I began reading CS books, coding, building projects, and really doing everything I could to make a career in full-stack development a reality. 
					</p>

					<p>
					My focus has been, JS and related frameworks considering its current relevance - Node, React Native, Solidity, it's really exciting stuff!
					</p>

					<p>
					In addition to these, I have limited exposure to C and Python through various channels, and feel confident about picking up new frameworks and languages as well.

					<h2>Gap Year / World Traveler</h2>
					<h5>Taught and learned abroad for a year</h5>
					<p>Traveled alone and taught in Vietnam, Mexico, Spain and Eastern Europe - Became self-reliant, resourceful, conscious</p>
					<h5 class = "">Click to Learn More</h5>

					<div class ="j-desc">

					<p>After finishing college, I headed by myself to Portugal and Spain, my mission was to find surf and sun.</p>

					<p>After that and much more, I caught a flight to the Baltic states. I frequented a bookstore in the city of Vilnius where it rained daily.</p>

					<p>It was there I made the acquaintance of a stonemason who was hitchiking to Budapest, through Poland. And so I joined, and we traveled by thumb.</p>

					<p>After a time in Budapest, Europe was beginning to get cold. I relocated to Mexico City and liked it enough not to ever want to leave.</p>

					<p>I looked for a job as a teacher, but the school year was distant, however the country of Vietnam was hiring teachers year-round. So I went there.</p>

					<p>I taught for six months, and was never cold. It was a really challenging place to live. Then at last I discovered my passion in programming.</p>

					<h2>Jurispage</h2>
					<h5>Website Project Manager</h5>

					<p>Jurispage is a web development start-up that found its niche in small law firms - I managed all client projects from sale to launch </p>

					<h5 class = "">Click to Learn More</h5>
					<div class = "j-desc">
						
					<p>Although still in college, I worked full-time at Jurispage where I was thrown into the deep end as the sole project manager, a role in which at the time I had very little experience. </p>

					<p>I was, in effect, the liaison between the salesperson, the developer, the client and the content writer (a four-spoke wheel, with me at the center)</p>

					<p>For better or worse, I was given near-complete accountability as the founders were working on a different start up and had little time to support. It was sink-or-swim.</p>

					<p>I also managed to build out marketing services for clients, wherein we would offer Google Adwords campaigns and supplementary sales to client websites. I would run campaigns for clients as well.</p>

					<p>This was an incredible learning experience and originally inspired my love for development. Also, the company was sold for seven figures at the end of my tenure.</p>

					<h2>Warby Parker</h2>
					<h5>Sales Advisor</h5>

					<p>Worked as a Sales Advisor in a Retail Location - Built Communication Skills, and Technical Eyewear Expertise</p>

					<h5 class = "">Click to Learn More</h5>
					<div class = "j-desc">

					<p>Served a key role in the Boston sales team. Although this was a retail role, technical eyewear expertise was required, as well as mastery of point-of-sale technology</p>

					<p>Warby Parker spends an incredible amount of time training its employees to communicate its brand value, having worked in other retail jobs, it didn't feel like 'faking it' to sell the product.</p>

					<p>To this day, I passionately still recommend Warby Parker, if you are reading this and wear glasses (or need sunglasses) I highly reccomend them.</p>

					<h5>Risk Analyst Co-op</h5>

					<p>A full time, 7 month tech-oriented 'co-op' in the Credit Risk Department - Big Data Mining and VBA</p>

					<h5 class = "">Click to Learn More</h5>
					<div class = "j-desc">
						<p>Here was perhaps my first exposure to technology's power in a professional environment. Our team used 'big data' to manipulate data into reports to pass on to portfolio managers</p>

						<p>The level of abstraction was very high, basically we used VBA macros on top of thousands of lines of database extracted trade-files to make sense of it all, show trends over time, and other things of that nature</p>

						<p>It was my first exposure to coding, and only a few people on the team knew how to actually write VBA. They were like the super heroes! I taught myself basic macros and it was very powerful stuff.</p>
