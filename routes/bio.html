					<h2>A Professional Journey</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>Aaron's journey as a developer began in college, while working at Bank of America. </p>

						<p>He taught himself VBA and ended up streamlining his job. Afterwards, he found himself with a lot of free time on his hands and basically eliminated the need for his own role!</p>

					<h4>Upon discovering this fascination with the power of automation and basic programming, he joined a web-development start-up called Jurispage </h4>

					<p> While still taking college classes, Aaron worked full-time at Jurispage for a year. Jurispage designs websites for small law firms and manages online marketing for them</p>

					<h3>As the sole project manager, Aaron worked as liaison between the salesperson, developer, client, and content writers to push out polished finished websites</h3>

					<h4>Over a year, Jurispage grew exponentially and was sold to a larger company for seven figures.</h4>

					<p>At the time of the sale, Aaron was graduating and had saved some money. He traveled for that summer and traveled. What was supposed to be a month turned into 2, and then 3. In the end, Aaron settled in Vietnam for 7 months where he became an English teacher. </p>

					<h4>After getting serious about this idea, Aaron returned to the U.S. where he did a deep-dive into learning full-stack development, absorbing everything available and creating personal projects</h4>

					<p>Aaron is now a full-fledged developer with professional project management experience.</p>
